## Classifying crop leaf using Keras convolutional neural network

Created a DeepLearning Model that is able to classify 7 leaf diseases using transfer learning method with pre-trained model VGG16. 

The 7 different types of leaf categories that are classified using pre-trained model are:
- Corn
- Pomegranate
- Paddy
- Pepper bell
- Tomato
- Potato
- Groundnut
